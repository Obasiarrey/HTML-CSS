        <p>My name is Mary and I created <a href="home.html">LET'SING</a> as an extension for my love of music from different choirs or acapela groups</p>
      <div para1>
        <p>For most of my life i have admired the music and melody produced by various individuals or choirs to a point wher i joined one which is the <a href="#"> Holy Union Choir</a> while in the choir i noticed difficulty in gainning good music skills and also getting more inspiration from other good choirs. </p>
        <p> SO this website will help choirs to show case their talents, their activities which they carry out, see how other choirs or acapela groups function during their different programs and why not invite choirs  or acapela groups for occasions Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
